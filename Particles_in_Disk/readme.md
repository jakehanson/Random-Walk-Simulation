# Particle(s) in a disk
This simulation is designed to simulate ants in a circular nest with a single aperture. More specifically, this code looks at the amount of time a single ant spends bouncing around inside a specified nest geometry. To do this, an ant starts in the center of the aperture with a random downward angle and runs until the particle escapes. The results are then compared to real experiments in which single ants entered nests of different geometries and spent recorded amount of time inside. As the Disk Animation Jupyter Notebook shows, the experiment differs quite substantially from the simulation. However, its possible that the velocity of the ants is also dependent on the nest geometry, which is something that will be explored.
